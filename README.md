# Letter frequencies
Simple program used to illustrate performance problems. You should be able to optimize this program to run about twice as fast.

specs of the laptop for the test 

win 8 64 bit  
version number 6.3 build 9600
cpu amd e1-6010 apu ( max 1.35 GHz) duel core

measurement the methode to find its bottleneck and optimite that part of the code..

like run a methode 1000 times and get run time for each run and get the avage run time and calculate the deviation.

we ran the default methode
